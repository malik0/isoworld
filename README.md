# isoworld

This repository contains a simple isometric world generator written in Python. It randomly generates height values for a grid of tiles and renders them using a basic ASCII isometric projection.

## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script prints an isometric view of the generated world to the console.
